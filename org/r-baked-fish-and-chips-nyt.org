1 1/2 teaspoons minced thyme
1 large garlic clove, grated on a microplane or minced
1 teaspoon black pepper, more as needed
1/4 cup Dijon mustard

(Chip directions left out --- see original for chips.)


  - Place a large rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and heat oven
    to 500 degrees.

  - In a large skillet over medium heat, warm 2 tablespoons oil. Stir in
    panko, thyme, garlic and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring
    frequently, until crumbs are evenly dark golden brown, about 5
    minutes. Transfer immediately to a bowl. 

  - In a separate bowl, whisk together mustard and eggs. Place flour in a
    third bowl.

  - Grease an oven-safe wire rack with oil and place it over another
    rimmed baking sheet. Season fish with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon
    pepper. Dredge each piece of fish in the flour, then mustard mixture,
    then panko mixture, making sure it is well coated with each one before
    moving to the next. Transfer fish to the wire rack. (You can bread the
    fish up to 4 hours ahead; store in the refrigerator, uncovered, either
    on the rack or just on a plate.)

  - Reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees and transfer the pan, with
    the fish still on the wire rack, to ovenâ€™s top rack. Bake until
    fish is flaky and golden, about 10 to 15 minutes more.
