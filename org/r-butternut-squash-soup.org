 To prepare soup, melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high
 heat. Add squash, carrot, and onion; saut√© for 12 minutes. Add chicken
 broth, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 30
 minutes. Remove from heat; stir in half-and-half and salt.

 Place squash mixture in a blender. Remove center piece of blender lid
 (to allow steam to escape), and secure blender lid on blender. Place a
 clean towel over opening in blender lid (to avoid splatters). Blend
 until smooth.
