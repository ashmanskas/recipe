We have recently been starting with freshly roasted chicken meat, so
we'll skip the part about preparing the chicken.

 *misc*
  - corn tortillas (better than flour) --- about a dozen of them
    - total about 10 tortillas
  - chicken
  - shredded mexican cheese

 *salsa verde*

  - a pound or so of tomatillos (rinse and drain if canned)
  - 1 small white onion, chopped (not too much, or it's bitter)
  - a clove or so of garlic, chopped
  - a serrano chile, seeds removed
  - 4 or 5 stems of fresh cilantro
  - throw all of this into food processor

 *directions*
  - cook chicken (recipe says about 2 pounds)
  - preheat oven to 375F
  - make salsa verde
  - don't bother frying the tortillas; just warm them in a dry skillet
  - assemble enchiladas: some salsa beneath; chicken & salsa inside;
    some salsa on top
  - sprinkle shredded cheese (we didn't like original recipe's cheese
    suggestion)
  - bake 375F about 15 min, until sauce bubbles and cheese is melted
