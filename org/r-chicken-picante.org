 I found this on the web.  It is similar, but not identical, to my old
 recipe, which I must have buried in my email somewhere

 1 onion, chopped
 1 tbsp garlic powder
 1 tbsp vegetable oil
 2 zucchini, cut into round slices

 12 oz shredded cheddar cheese

 cube chicken breasts.  heat oil in medium skillet.  saute chicken,
 onion, and garlic powder, until chicken is cooked through.

 add zucchini, let it soften a bit.

 add tomatoes and picante sauce.  simmer 30 minutes, until thickened.

 sprinkle cheese on top.
