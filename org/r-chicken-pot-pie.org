 1.  Make crust and chill until ready to use.

 2.  Preheat oven to 400F.

 3.  To prepare filling, melt 2 teaspoons butter in a Dutch oven over
     meduim-high heat. Add carrot, onion, and thyme; cook 8 minutes or
     until vegetables are soft. Add broth and potato; bring to a
     boil. Cover and simmer 10 minutes. Combine flour and 1/3 cup water in
     a small bowl; stir with a whisk until smooth. Return potato mixture to
     a boil. Slowly drizzle flour mixture into potato mixture, stirring
     constantly. Cook 1 minute or until mixture thickens. Stir in chicken,
     peas, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Spoon chicken mixture into an 11
     x 7-inch glass or ceramic baking dish coated with cooking spray. Place
     dough on top of chicken mixture, pressing to edge of dish. Cut 4 slits
     in top of crust to allow steam to escape. Gently brush crust with
     milk. Bake at 400Â° for 50 minutes or until golden and bubbly. Let
     stand 10 minutes.
