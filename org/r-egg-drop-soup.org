#+begin_verse
 1/4 tsp sugar
 5 c chicken broth
 1 Tsp cornstarch mixed with 1/4 c cold water
 2 eggs, beaten until slightly foamy
 2 green onions, cut into pea size pieces, including green part
 2 tsp sesame oil

 1.  Add sugar to broth.  Bring to a rapid boil.
 2.  Add cornstarch mixture.  Stir and cook until soup is no longer
 cloudy.
 3.  Slowly swirl in beaten eggs (I drop it in in fairly large drops
 because otherwise it becomes little stringy bits of eggs instead of
 the nice bigger chunks).  Do not stir!  Turn off heat at once.
 4.  Drop in scallions and sesame oil.  Stir gently.  Serve.
