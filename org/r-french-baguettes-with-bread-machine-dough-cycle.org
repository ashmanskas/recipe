1.5 tsp bread machine yeast

- Place ingredients in bread pan as indicated by recipe. Select the
  dough cycle, and start.
- Dough will be sticky and wet once cycle is completed, resist the
  temptation to add more flour.
- Place dough on a lightly floured board, cover with a large bowl or a
  towel, and let rest for 15 minutes.
- Cut into 2 pieces, and form each into a 3Ã—14-inch oval. Place loaves
  on prepared baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover, and let
  rise for approximately 40 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
- Cut diagonal slashes in the dough, and then place loaves in the oven
  on the middle rack. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes.  (More like 25 is
  better.)
- During baking, spritz loaves with water every 5 to 10 minutes for a
  crispier crust if you like.
