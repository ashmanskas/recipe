#+begin_verse
  4  Tbsp  Margarine or butter
 1-2 tsp  Oregano
 1-2 tsp  Minced garlic (the jarred, dried kind works fine)
 1-2 Tbsp Grated parmesan cheese
#+end_verse

 Mix all the ingredients together, spread on sliced Italian, French, or
 sourdough bread, and broil it in the toaster oven until the top just
 starts to turn brown.  Keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn!
