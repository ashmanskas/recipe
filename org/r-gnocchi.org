 Gnocchi

#+begin_verse
 3 large baking (Idaho) potatoes (about 1 3/4 pounds), scrubbed
 1 large egg
 1 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper
 Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg
 1/4 freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, or as needed
#+end_verse

 Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough cold water to
 cover. Bring the water to a boil and cook, partially covered, until
 the potatoes are easily pierced with a skewer but the skins are not
 split, about 35 minutes. (Alternatively, the potatoes can be baked in
 a preheated 400Â°F oven until tender, about 40 minutes.)

 Drain the potatoes and let them stand just until cool enough to
 handle. (The hotter the potatoes are when they are peeled and riced,
 the lighter the gnocchi will be.) Working quickly and protecting the
 hand that holds the potatoes with a folded kitchen towel or oven mitt,
 scrape the skin from the potato with a paring knife. Press the peeled
 potatoes through a potato ricer. Alternatively, the potatoes can be
 passed through a food mill fitted with the fine disc, but a ricer
 makes fluffier potatoes and therefore lighter gnocchi. Spread the
 riced potatoes into a thin, even layer on the work surface, without
 pressing them or compacting them. Let them cool completely.

 In a small bowl, beat the egg, salt, pepper, and nutmeg
 together. Gather the cold potatoes into a mound and form a well in the
 center. Pour the egg mixture into the well. Knead the potato and egg
 mixtures together with both hands, gradually adding the grated cheese
 and enough of the flour, about 1 1/2 cups, to form a smooth but
 slightly sticky dough. It should take no longer than 3 minutes to work
 the flour into the potato mixture; remember, the longer the dough is
 kneaded, the more flour it will require and the heavier it will
 become. As you knead the dough, it will stick to your hands and to the
 work surface: Repeatedly rub this rough dough from your hands and
 scrape it with a knife or dough scraper from the work surface back
 into the dough as you knead.

 Wash and dry your hands. Dust the dough, your hands, and the work
 surface lightly with some of the remaining flour. Cut the dough into
 six equal pieces and set off to one side of the work surface. Place
 one piece of dough in front of you and pat it into a rough
 oblong. Using both hands, in a smooth back-and-forth motion and
 exerting light downward pressure, roll the dough into a rope 1/2 inch
 thick, flouring the dough if necessary as you roll to keep it from
 sticking. (When you first begin making gnocchi, until your hands get
 the feel of the dough, you may find it easier to cut each piece of
 dough in half to roll it.)

 Slice the ropes into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Sprinkle the rounds
 lightly with flour and roll each piece quickly between your palms into
 a rough ball, flouring the dough and your hands as needed to prevent
 sticking. Hold the tines of a fork at a 45-degree angle to the table
 with the concave part facing up. Dip the tip of your thumb in
 flour. Take one ball of dough and with the tip of your thumb, press
 the dough lightly against the tines of the fork as you roll it
 downward toward the tips of the tines. As the dough wraps around the
 tip of your thumb, it will form into a dumpling with a deep
 indentation on one side and a ridged surface on the other. Set on a
 baking sheet lined with a floured kitchen towel and continue forming
 gnocchi from the remaining dough balls. Repeat the whole process with
 the remaining pieces of dough. At this point the gnocchi must be
 cooked immediately or frozen.

 To cook gnocchi: Bring six quarts of salted water to a vigorous boil
 in a large pot over high heat. Drop about half the gnocchi into the
 boiling water a few at a time, stirring gently and continuously with a
 wooden spoon. Cook the gnocchi, stirring gently, until tender, about 1
 minute after they rise to the surface. (You can cook the gnocchi all
 at once in two separate pots of boiling water. If you make a double
 batch of gnocchi, I strongly recommend cooking them in batches in two
 pots of water.)

 Remove the gnocchi from the water with a slotted spoon of skimmer,
 draining them well, and transfer to a wide saucepan with some of the
 sauce to be used. Cook the remaining gnocchi, if necessary. When all
 the gnocchi are cooked, proceed according to the directions for
 saucing and serving in each recipe.
