 This easy hummus recipe replaces most of the traditional tahini with yogurt.

 Ingredients:

     * 1 15 oz can of chickpeas or garbanzo beans, drained (save liquid)
     * 1-2 cloves garlic, crushed
     * 1 tablespoon lemon juice
     * 1 tablespoon tahini, or low fat peanut butter if you prefer 
         (optional, but if you do not use, increase yogurt by 1 TBLS
     * 1/2 cup plain yogurt
     * 1 teaspoon salt 
     * dash of cumin


 Preparation:

 In a food processor combine beans, tahini (if desired), yogurt,
 garlic, and lemon juice. Blend well. Add salt and cumin and blend to a
 smooth and creamy dip.

 If the hummus is too thick, add a little bit of the liquid from the
 chickpeas - about a teaspoon at time. Other ways to thin out hummus are
 by using warm water or olive oil.
