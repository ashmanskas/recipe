|   * | clean dish towels to wring water from potato/onion       |
|   2 | large Russet potatoes (about 1 lb), quartered lengthwise |
|     | (I peeled potatoes, contrary to recipe.)                 |
|   1 | large onion (half pound), peeled and cut                 |
|     | into quarters                                            |
|   2 | large eggs                                               |
| 1/2 | cup all-purpose flour                                    |
|   2 | tsp kosher salt                                          |
|   1 | tsp baking powder                                        |
| 1/2 | tsp freshly ground black pepper                          |
|   * | oil for frying                                           |


1. Grate potatoes and onion coarsely with food processor.  Transfer
   mix to clean dishtowl and squeeze out water.
2. Put mix into large bowl.  Add eggs, flour, salt, baking powder,
   pepper; mix until flour is absorbed.  (I mixed eggs..pepper with
   food processor, but don't mix so long that it thickens.)
3. Heat 1/4 inch oil In a medium heavy-bottomed pan over medium-high
   heat.  Once oil is hot (drop of batter sizzles in pan), use a
   *heaping* tablespoon to drop the batter into the hot pan, cooking
   in batches.  Use a spatula (90-degree spatula is handy!) to
   flatten.  Flip once edges are brown and crispy (about 5 min).  Cook
   until second side is deeply browned (about 5 min).  Transfer latkes
   to paper-towel-lined plate to drain.  Repeat.
