#+begin_verse
 1 c large elbow macaroni
 1.5 c (about 1/2 lb) American cheese, diced
 1 egg
 several pats butter
 1 c milk
#+end_verse

 Cook and drain macaroni.  Put a layer of macaroni in baking dish, then
 a layer of cheese.  Put one pat of butter in each corner of dish and
 the center.  Repeat layers: macaroni, cheese, then butter.  Beat egg
 and add milk.  Pour over macaroni and cheese.  (Maybe add a tiny bit
 more milk here, but not too much or it will be really runny.)  Bake
 uncovered at 350 for 30 minutes.
