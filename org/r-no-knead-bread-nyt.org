 Here is one of the most popular recipes The Times has ever published,
 courtesy of Jim Lahey, owner of Sullivan Street Bakery. It requires no
 kneading. It uses no special ingredients, equipment or techniques. And
 it takes very little effort --- only time. You will need 24 hours to
 create the bread, but much of this is unattended waiting, a slow
 fermentation of the dough that results in a perfect loaf.

 3 cups all-purpose or bread flour

 1/4 tsp instant yeast

 1.25 tsp salt

 cornmeal for dusting
