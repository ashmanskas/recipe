: 
:  1 (15 oz) pkg ricotta (see variation)  1 clove garlic, chopped
:  1 pkg chopped spinach, thawed          1 tsp ground cumin
:  1/4 c chopped onion                    1/2 tsp coriander
:  1/4 c yogurt (or sour cream)           1/2 tsp turmeric
:  1" ginger, grated                      2 chiles, chopped
: 

 - Bake ricotta for 40 min at 350.  Cut into cubes.

 - Varation: Use tofu instead of ricotta.  Dry then bake at 200 for 30
   min.

 - Heat oil & fry onion, garlic, ginger, chiles until onion is
   golden.  Add spices, then yogurt (or sour cream), then spinach.  Add
   cheese (or tofu) & 1/2 cup water.  Simmer for 15 minutes.

 (A favorite Indian restaurant gets this much smoother and creamier
 than I have ever managed.  They say they achieve this by letting it
 cook slowly for hours.)
