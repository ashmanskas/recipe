  5-7 tbsp ice water
  2/3 cup butter-flavor shortening

 Remember to check that you have a pie pan!

 Combine flour and salt and sift well with fork.  Add shortening and
 work into flour mixture with fork or pastry blender until you have
 pea-sized chunks of flour/shortening mixture.  Add water 1 tbsp at a
 time, gently mixing after each addition until most of dough has
 clumped in larger chunks (usually about 6 tbsp of water).  Gather
 dough into a ball and refrigerage for 30 min.  Cut ball in half and
 roll each half out separately for top and bottom crusts.  If dough
 sticks to rolling pin or rolling surface, gather it up, sprinkle
 surface and dough with flour, and roll out again.  Line pie pan with
 crust, crimp edges, and use with recipe of your choice.
