 (All of these seasoning measurements are approximate.)

 1. Heat oil and saute onions and garlic until soft.
 2. Add all other ingredients.
 3. Bring just to a boil, then lower heat to simmer and cover pot. 
    Simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Make sure you stir it once in a 
    while and taste it occasionally to make sure you don't want to 
    add more of any seasonings.
