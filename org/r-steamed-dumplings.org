- dough ( [[http://www.chow.com/recipes/28052-basic-dumpling-dough][source]] )

  - 10 ounces (2 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour
  - About 3/4 cup just-boiled water (see Note)

- cooking ( [[http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/vegetarian-steamed-dumplings-recipe/index.html][source]] )

  Using a steaming apparatus of your choice, bring 1/4 to 1/2-inch of
  water to a simmer over medium heat. Spray the steamer's surface
  lightly with the non-stick vegetable spray to prevent
  sticking. Place as many dumplings as will fit into a steamer,
  without touching each other. Cover and steam for 10 to 12 minutes
  over medium heat. Remove the dumplings from the steamer to a
  heatproof platter and place in oven to keep warm. Repeat until all
  dumplings are cooked.
