 (4 servings)

 2 lbs eggplant
 3 Tbsp oil for frying
 2 whole dried chili peppers
 6 cloves garlic, minced
 2 scalions, chopped, incl green part

 (I sometimes toss in some extra veggies 
 if it's the only dish I'm cooking)

 sauce:
 1 Tbsp Szechwan sweet bean sauce or ground bean sauce

 Make 4 slashes around eggplant, about 1" deep.  Steam until soft.
 Cool.  Tear into thin strips lengthwise.  Discard some seeds.

 Heat oil in wok.  Fry chili peppers until dark brown & discard.  Add
 garlic & scallions & brown slightly.  Add sauce mix & cook to bubble.
