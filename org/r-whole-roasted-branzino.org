 2 whole branzino (Mediterranean sea bass)
 several sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley and thyme
 1 lemon, sliced thinly
 2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced
 sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
 extra virgin olive oil

- Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.

- Use a sharp knife to cut several diagonal slits on both sides of
  each fish. Rub the outside of each fish with salt and pepper and
  generously season its cavity. Brush the fish, inside and out, with
  olive oil.

- Stuff the cavities with a few sprigs of herbs, the lemon slices and
  garlic.

- Place the fish on a well-oiled baking sheet and roast for about 20
  minutes (until the fish flakes easily).
